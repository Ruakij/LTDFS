# 1. Description

This project is a network-filesystem based on FUSE which can be spanned across multiple locations, also with "higher" latency (up to 50-100ms). (although performance is expected to drop in this sync-mode)

This is for me a deeper dive into the C language and FUSE with the library [libfuse](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse).
